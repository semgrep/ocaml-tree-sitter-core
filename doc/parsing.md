Interpreting the output of tree-sitter
==

Introduction to the problem
--

Ideally, the result of tree-sitter parsing should be an AST that can
be used directly. It is not the case because the json output of such
parsers only return a node per rule name.

The following grammar is unproblematic:

```javascript
sum: $ => seq($.number, '+', $.number)
```

The above translates to the OCaml type:

```ocaml
type sum = number * Token.t * number
```

The output of parsing `1 + 1` is a `sum` node with 3 children `1`,
`+`, and `1`, whose json representation is essentially the following
(source location info omitted for brevity):

```json
{
  "type": "sum",
  "children": [
    { "type": "number" },
    { "type": "+" },
    { "type": "number }
  ]
}
```

However, other constructs than `seq()` are problematic because they
have multiple ways of matching, and the result doesn't indicate which
branch was taken. These constructs are:

* `choice()`
* `repeat()`
* `repeat1()`
* `optional()`

A simple grammar that results in ambiguous output is this:

```javascript
nums: $ => seq(optional($.number),
               optional($.number))
```

The OCaml AST type for this is:

```ocaml
type nums = number option * number option
```

Giving the input `42` to the tree-sitter parser results in just this
output:

```json
{
  "type": "nums",
  "children": [
    { "type": "number" },
  ]
}
```

This doesn't tell us which of the two options was matched. The OCaml
value could be `(Some "42", None)` or `(None, Some "42")`, depending
on parsing order. In this case, our OCaml parser proceeds from left to
right, longest-match-first, and will end up with `(Some "42", None)`.

Solution and trade-offs
--

We just saw that the parsing result of tree-sitter doesn't include
nodes for the different kinds of repeats (`optional()`, `repeat()`,
`repeat1()). It also doesn't indicate which branch of a `choice()` was
matched.

For example, we could have something like this:

```javascript
exp: $ => choice(
  seq($.number, '+', $.number),
  seq($.number, '*', $.number)
)
```

The OCaml type for this is:
```ocaml
type exp = [
  | `Exp_num_PLUS_num of (number * Token.t * number)
  | `Exp_num_STAR_num of (number * Token.t * number)
]
```

Note the names that were generated y ocaml-tree-sitter for each
alternative. See [ast.md](ast.md) for a review of naming issues.

The json output of parsing `2 * 2` is the following:
```json
{
  "type": "exp",
  "children": [
    { "type": "number" },
    { "type": "*" },
    { "type": "number" }
  ]
}
```

The OCaml value that we recover from that needs to be
`` `Exp_num_STAR_num (..., ..., ...) ``.

In the end, the problem is to match a sequence of named tokens
(`number`, `*`, `number`) against a tree forming a regular
expression (combination of symbols, sequences, repeats, and alternatives).

Trade-offs:

* We don't bother with whether tree-sitter GLR parsing would
  prioritize one path over another, or whether it would never match
  a specific path. We proceed from left to right, longest match first,
  and then backtrack as needed.
* This is fine in practice because these regular expressions to match
  against `children` sequences of symbols are relatively simple and
  normally unambiguous.

The job of matching a regular expression over a sequence of symbols
and turning it into the appropriate OCaml AST node is done by
generated code. This is the code in `Parse.ml`, which is plain and
straightforward to understand. It is recommended to run the tests with
`make test` and then inspect the generated code for a simple example
under `tests`.
