(*
   A generic tree type meant to accommodate all tree types derived
   from tree-sitter grammars.

   Such generic trees are constructed automatically as part of the
   generated boilerplate (Boilerplate.ml files). They are used
   to represent nodes that are waiting for a partial or full manual
   translation.
*)

(*
   Type of a raw tree.

   Question 1:

   Should we include type names? We don't have type names for all constructs
   but when we do, it could allow us to start a semgrep pattern search
   from a node of a specific type. It's not clear whether it's something
   we want to support.

   Question 2:

   Should we use a simpler tree type like the following?

     type 'a t =
       | Atom of Token.t
       | List of 'a t list
       | Any of 'a

   This may make it harder to modify the generated boilerplate.
   For example, we could decide to support semgrep ellipses within all the
   lists but not in tuples.
*)
type 'a t =
  | Token of Token.t (* keyword, identifier, punctuation, int literal, ... *)
  | List of 'a t list (* sequence of variable length [repeat] *)
  | Tuple of 'a t list (* sequence of fixed length (wrt type) [seq] *)
  | Case of string * 'a t (* tagged value = variant [choice] *)
  | Option of 'a t option (* optional value [optional] *)
  | Any of 'a (* allows integration in a richer tree type *)
