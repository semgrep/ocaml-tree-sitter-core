(*
   A translated node from the original parse tree from tree-sitter.

   The node 'type', which is a rule name (e.g. "expression")
   or a literal symbol (e.g. "+"), is paired with some contents translated
   from the original tree-sitter parse tree. Examples:

     ("expression", Children ...)

     ("+", Leaf (..., "+"))

   This is a token for the regular expression matcher, hence the name
   'matcher_token'. It is not in general a token wrt the tree-sitter
   grammar.
*)
type matcher_token = node_kind * matcher_token_body

(*
   The contents of a tree-sitter node, in which each sequence of 'children'
   nodes is now a tree matching the regular expression that represents
   the rule body.

   'Children' is a representation of the original "children" field from
   tree-sitter.

   'Leaf' is a representation of a node without children, i.e. a token
   in the grammar handled by tree-sitter. It is also used to represent
   error nodes which may have children that were discarded because we
   don't know how to interpret them.
