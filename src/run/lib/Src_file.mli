(*
   Load an input file. It gets resolved into lines and columns.

val load_file : string -> t

(*
   Load source code from a string. The optional 'src_file' is for
   pointing to the source file in error messages.
   If 'src_file' is unspecified, the name of the file in error messages
   can be set with 'src_name' without having to be a valid path.
   The default for 'src_name' is "<source>".
*)
val load_string : ?src_name:string -> ?src_file:string -> string -> t

(*
   Return the substring corresponding to the specified region.
   It may or may not coincide with the boundaries of a token.

   Arguments: start, end_ where end_ is the position of the first character
   *after* the selection region.

(*
   Get the specified line from the line array.
   The first line (row) is numbered 0.
   If the requested line is out of range, the empty string is returned.
