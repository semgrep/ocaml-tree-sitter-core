Input files that are expected to parse successfully must be located in
test/ok or in its subfolders. Files that are expected to fail must be
placed under test/xfail.

*** Some $lang parsing tests didn't meet the expectations.

The lists of failing targets are here:
  - '$fail_list': parsing was expected to succeed but failed
  - '$xpass_list': parsing was expected to fail but succeeded

The output of the parser for each file was put in '$outdir/'. Alternatively,
you can run the parser '$parser' on an arbitrary file to see
what the CST looks like. If a target fails but the parser can't be fixed
right away, move it to 'test/xfail/'. You may create subfolders such as
'test/xfail/todo' or 'text/xfail/experimental' to be more descriptive.
